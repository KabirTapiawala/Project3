# Dev Log - November 27, 2024

## Project Overview
The project is an interactive program designed to manage an index file using a B-Tree structure. The program will present a menu to the user, allowing them to execute various commands to manipulate the index file. Key features include:

- Creating and opening index files.
- Inserting key/value pairs.
- Searching for keys.
- Loading data from a file.
- Printing and extracting key/value pairs.
- Handling user input errors and file overwrites.

## Initial Thoughts
The program will need to handle file operations robustly, ensuring data integrity and user-friendly error handling. The B-Tree implementation will be crucial, especially managing memory efficiently by keeping only three nodes in memory at a time.

## Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**: I Create the necessary files and directories.
2. **Implement File Operations**: I Start with basic file creation and opening functionalities.
3. **Develop B-Tree Structure**: I will Implement the B-Tree with minimal degree 10.
4. **Command Handling**: I Implement the command menu and corresponding functionalities.
5. **Error Handling**: I Ensure robust error handling for user inputs and file operations.
6. **Testing**: I Thoroughly test each component to ensure reliability.
